# You recently graduated college and you are applying for a programming job that requires the understanding of loops
# in Python. The manager you are interviewing with has asked you to take an assessment to prove your programming
# knowledge. Below are the requirements for the programming skills test.
# In Python, create a program that meets the following requirements:
# Take two integers from the user.
# Save the lower number as x.
# Save the largest integer as y.
# Write a loop that counts from x to y by twos.
# Print out the values of that loop using the Print function in Python.
# Write another loop that adds x and y, and saves the value as Z.
# Print out the values of Z using the Print function in Python.
# Provide the code and take a screenshot of the output, then paste the screenshot(s) into a MicrosoftÂ® Word document.

#Review Chapters 6 and 11 of Python for Everyone if you have additional questions on creating a program in Python.

#Submit your document.
